# NewsWorld

its a basic , simple , easy to use and most importantly functional news web app .(Learning purpose)

Step 1: Get to Know the Source 🕵️‍♂️
Head over to gnews.io ( https://gnews.io/ ) and grab yourself an API key. No key, no news, no glory!

Step 2: Frontend – Make it Shine ✨
Develop a sleek, user-friendly UI where users can read news like they’re sipping hot coffee with a fresh newspaper. The design can be completely up to you , but keep in mind, we’re aiming for something that looks sharp on mobile, tablet, AND desktop. In other words: responsive design is key!

Step 3: Backend – Power it Up 🚀
Set up the backend to pull news articles from the gnews.io API and serve them fresh to the frontend. You’ll need to handle pagination, search, and all that nerdy backend magic. 🔮

Step 4: Firebase is Your Home 🏡
Host your masterpiece on Firebase Free Tier . (Because what’s more fun than deploying an app and watching it come to life? 🎬)

Step 5: Share the Glory 🌟
